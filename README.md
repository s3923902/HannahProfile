# Personal Information
My name is Hannah, I was born and raised in Sydney. My parents are originally from Korean and growing up I was always stuck in between cultures. As stereotypes go, math is my worst nightmare, but I play a musical instrument and majored in classical piano for 1 year before I decided that I could not pursue a career in music and decided to look for a different avenue. My favourite hobby is travelling and learning new languages. I fluently speak Korean and am currently learning Chinese Mandarin with a group of friends. I am also in the process of learning Spanish on the side.

# Interest in IT
Q: What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? 

My interest in IT is the field of Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence. After completing an introductory course in Cyber Security when I studied a diploma in IT, I become aware of how â€¦

I chose to come to RMIT because I wanted to continue my studies in IT while working simultaneously. I am currenting working as an office admin and I have come to love my work environment, my colleagues, and my job that I would love to continue where I am with my work for as long as possible. Since RMIT offered online studies, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to pursue my career in the IT field.

What do you expect to learn during your studies?

I understand that IT covers a wide branch, and I would like to deepen my understanding of the different branches and jobs available in this field. I expect to learn practical skills such as programming and research methods into tracing back user footprints as well as research methods to understand how other users view IT and apply it in their own lives to improve IT experiences.
