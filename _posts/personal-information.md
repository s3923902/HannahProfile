title: Personal Information
---

My name is Hannah, I was born and raised in Sydney. My parents are originally from Korean and growing up I was always stuck in between cultures. 
As stereotypes go, math is my worst nightmare, but I play a musical instrument and majored in classical piano for 1 year before I decided that I could not pursue a career in music and decided to look for a different avenue. 
My favourite hobby is travelling and learning new languages. I fluently speak Korean and am currently learning Chinese Mandarin with a group of friends. I am also in the process of learning Spanish on the side.
