<h1><u>Personal Information</u></h1>

<p>
My name is Hannah, I was born and raised in Sydney. My parents are originally from Korean and growing up I was always stuck in between cultures. 
As stereotypes go, math is my worst nightmare, but I play a musical instrument and majored in classical piano for 1 year before I decided that 
I could not pursue a career in music and decided to look for a different avenue. My favourite hobby is travelling and learning new languages. 
I fluently speak Korean and lived in China for a short period of time to learn Chinese. 
I am still currently learning Mandarin with a group of friends and am learning Spanish on the side.

<h1> <u> Interest in IT </u> </h1>

<p>
My interest in IT is the field of Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence. After completing an introductory course in Cyber Security 
when I studied a diploma in IT, I become aware of how vulnerable our data and security is against hackers or cyber criminals who are 
determined to steal data for dangerous motives. Different case studies taught me the importance of cyber security to protect the data and 
security of each individuals, especially those who lack knowledge in cyber security and are unaware of their vulnerabilities. 
My interest in artificial intelligence stemmed after learning about Teslaâ€™s autopilot features. 
The ideas and concepts are revolutionary but the ethics are debatable since computers cannot make the same conscious decisions that humans can make. 
As technology evolves, more revolutionary tools will be developed to heighten the comfort of humans but I believe the same ethical 
questions will rise and this never-ending debate continues to interest me.

I chose to come to RMIT because I wanted to continue my studies in IT while working simultaneously. 
I am currenting working as an office admin and I have come to love my work environment, my colleagues, and my job that 
I would love to continue where I am with my work for as long as possible. Also, in order to pay for my holidays, this meant that I needed to be
savvy with my money and maintain an income.
Since RMIT offered online studies, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to pursue my career in the IT field while doing the work I enjoy.

I understand that IT covers a wide branch, and I would like to deepen my understanding of the different branches and jobs available in this field. 
I expect to learn practical skills such as programming and research methods into tracing back user footprints as well as research methods to 
understand how other users view IT and apply it in their own lives to improve IT experiences.
