<h1><u>Personal Information</u></h1>

<p>
My name is Hannah, I was born and raised in Sydney. My parents are originally from Korean and growing up I was always stuck in between cultures. 
As stereotypes go, math is my worst nightmare, but I play a musical instrument and majored in classical piano for 1 year before I decided that 
I could not pursue a career in music and decided to look for a different avenue. My favourite hobby is travelling and learning new languages. 
I fluently speak Korean and lived in China for a short period of time to learn Chinese. 
I am still currently learning Mandarin with a group of friends and am learning Spanish on the side.

<h1> <u> Interest in IT </u> </h1>

<p>
My interest in IT is the field of Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence. After completing an introductory course in Cyber Security 
when I studied a diploma in IT, I become aware of how vulnerable our data and security is against hackers or cyber criminals who are 
determined to steal data for dangerous motives. Different case studies taught me the importance of cyber security to protect the data and 
security of each individuals, especially those who lack knowledge in cyber security and are unaware of their vulnerabilities. 
My interest in artificial intelligence stemmed after learning about Teslaâ€™s autopilot features. 
The ideas and concepts are revolutionary but the ethics are debatable since computers cannot make the same conscious decisions that humans can make. 
As technology evolves, more revolutionary tools will be developed to heighten the comfort of humans but I believe the same ethical 
questions will rise and this never-ending debate continues to interest me.
  </p>

  <p>
I chose to come to RMIT because I wanted to continue my studies in IT while working simultaneously. 
I am currenting working as an office admin and I have come to love my work environment, my colleagues, and my job that 
I would love to continue where I am with my work for as long as possible. Also, in order to pay for my holidays, this meant that I needed to be
savvy with my money and maintain an income.
Since RMIT offered online studies, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to pursue my career in the IT field while doing the work I enjoy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
I understand that IT covers a wide branch, and I would like to deepen my understanding of the different branches and jobs available in this field. 
I expect to learn practical skills such as programming and research methods into tracing back user footprints as well as research methods to 
understand how other users view IT and apply it in their own lives to improve IT experiences.

<h1><u> Ideal Job </u></h1>

  <img src = "CyberSecurityAnalyst.png" alt = "Cyber Security Analyst Job Ad">
  
  <p> 
    This is a position which searches and locates vulnerabilities which are in the system to prevent an attack, 
    responds when an attack occurs and traces back the steps of how a breach occurred after a cyber-attack. 
    This position is particularly appealing because it handles multiple different roles in cyber security. 
    Since each task and situation will be different, no two days will be the same. Further, with each task there will also be 
    different methodologies to approach the cyber landscape and the methods used to mitigate, 
    respond to and investigate cyber threats and instances will be distinct each time. 
    This role also works as a part of a team which can help members bouncing ideas off each other and find a satisfactory result. 
    Not only this but knowing that my work is something that helps others for their benefit will also give me a high sense of accomplishment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Beyond basic programming skills and networking skills, this position requires an in-depth knowledge of the
    current trends of cyber security attacks as well as previous trends of cyber security breaches which will assist 
    in detecting cyber-attacks which have evolved from past methods. This position also needs multiple years of experience 
    working as either a software engineer or a career in cyber security such as a network incident responder, 
    network security engineer, system administrator or penetrator tester will be required. 
    They should be able to extract evidence from the network that shows the vulnerabilities or when tracing back how a cyber breach occurred. 
    This role also requires an individual who is proficient in systems engineering and encryption which will help them prevent breaches. 
    The candidate should have experience working as a part of a team which prevents, responds to or investigates cyber breaches. 
    Their experience and knowledge will help find vulnerabilities and notice the patterns in cyber threats when it occurs or 
    when investigating after a threat presents itself. Multiple certificates such as the Certified Information 
    Security Systems Professional (CISSP) or the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) will be beneficial with the role. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have basic programming skills in Java, SQL and Python. I also try to keep up with current cyber trends through news articles. 
    I currently lack in any experience in IT field but I believe other skills will also be beneficial in pursuing a career in this industry. 
    Due to my work, I have grown a high level of attention to detail which can be beneficial when investigating for
    vulnerabilities in the system and investigation. I am also used to working in teams and having open communication 
    with other team members for solutions that will solve the problems more efficiently and successfully. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I plan to complete a few cyber security certificates while completing my course in Bachelor of Information Technology. 
    Once this degree is completed, I would like to apply for a role in cyber security such as a security analyst, incident responder, 
    vulnerability assessor or digital forensic. However, if that is not possible, I would like to work as a software engineer, 
    data analyst or systems administrator and gain experience for some years working in the IT industry before moving on to more specific cyber security roles. 
    I would also need to continuously study and keep up to date with current threats and methods as well as the trends in cyber security.

    These results represent that I enjoy new experiences to gain more knowledge and understanding. 
    I am open to new ideas and concepts, preferring to be shown by text or demonstration to grasp the meaning behind new perceptions. 
    My learning style is highly visual but triggers are required for effective learning such as writing notes or drawing ideas out to remember the key points. 
    Since I am extraverted, I enjoy studying in a group setting but I can also be easily distracted when studying in a group and become a distraction to others. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Considering a team setting, these results reflect that I am open to learning about the ideas that other team members have, 
    even if they are contrary to my own opinions and belief system. I may need some encouragement to be more 
    self-disciplined and stick to strict deadlines but with encouragement from others, as a people pleaser, 
    I will be more inclined to please other team members and ensure my best work. These results show that with an extraverted personality, 
    I will enjoy open communication with other team members and keeping in touch during each process so everyone will be 
    on the same page without any misunderstandings.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In my opinion this shows that when forming a team, I need to look for personalities who are more disciplined and can lead the team, 
    assigning roles to each member. As an ENFP who enjoys exploring new ideas and learning different opinions, 
    it would be important to find team members who can bring differing opinions that can challenge each other and further develop those ideas. 
    Team members who also enjoy open communication would be a key to maintaining high team morale to continue 
    working towards the task and achieving the same goal.
