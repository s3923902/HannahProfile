title: Personal Information
---

My name is Hannah, I was born and raised in Sydney. My parents are originally from Korean and growing up I was always stuck in between cultures. As stereotypes go, math is my worst nightmare, but I play a musical instrument and majored in classical piano for 1 year before I decided that I could not pursue a career in music and decided to look for a different avenue. My favourite hobby is travelling and learning new languages. I fluently speak Korean and am currently learning Chinese Mandarin with a group of friends. I am also in the process of learning Spanish on the side. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94890493/145712441-7d865ed6-8f92-46af-b0e5-37c4e906f66a.png)
